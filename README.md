# GPC
Coded GPC algorithm presented in chapter 5 of "Model Predictive Control in the Process Industry" by Eduardo F. Camacho, Carlos A. Bordons
This code has been developed in MATLAB. 
The code is developed for an arbitrary system with any number of inputs and outputs. 
Matrixes A and B have been defined based on chapter 5 of the book. 
The provided code can regenerate the distillation column example in the book. 
For other cases, you should just provide the matrixes A and B of the system. 
Np and Nu in the code are the prediction horizon and the control horizon. 
The optimization process is so quick. 
You can combine this code with an identification algorithm to have a general control algorithm that can identify matrixes A and B and produce control inputs-
simultaneously. You can send an email to me for further clarification.
